# Welcome to Workstate

## How We Use Workstate

Workstate keeps agent work anchored in task state, review evidence, and
repeatable lifecycle commands. A normal loop is: choose a task plan, start a
linked worktree, implement a small slice, record verification, review, and then
finish or hand off with the state still recoverable by the next agent.

## Your Setup Checklist

### Codebases

- [ ] [workstate](https://github.com/darce/workstate)
- [ ] Optional consumer repo — sibling repo if a local installation needs verification

### MCP Servers to Activate

- [ ] workstate-handoff-mcp — Task state, decisions, review findings, slice/handoff lifecycle. Run `make context` to bootstrap.
- [ ] workstate-orchestrator-mcp — Lane/worker/worktree management, dispatch, turn metrics. Activated alongside workstate-handoff-mcp.
- [ ] ccd_session — Lightweight session helper. Optional; ask Daniel if you need it.

### Skills to Know About

- /incremental-implementation — Drive an approved task plan slice-by-slice. The team's primary build loop.
- /branch-lifecycle — Start/advance/finish a task branch (`make task-start`, `make review-ready`, `make task-finish`).
- /branch-review — Pre-merge review of a feature branch (`make review-run`).
- /plan-analyze — Triage a planning doc for ambiguity/gaps before formal review (`make plan-analyze DOC=...`).
- /planning-review — Formal review of task plans, epics, ADRs (`make plan-review DOC=...`).
- /scope — Clarify requirements before drafting a feature or epic.
- /handoff-lifecycle — Enter, resume, or end a task session (`make context`).

## Team Tips

- The workflow slash commands, harness hooks, and shared contracts live in
  bootstrap-generated, **gitignored** surfaces (`.agentic/generated/…`,
  `scripts/hooks/`, `docs/agentic/contracts/`, `Makefile.d/`). A fresh clone
  has none of them until you generate them — see Get Started below. If the `/…`
  commands ever stop resolving, that surface went missing; rebuild it.
- The root checkout stays on `main`. Feature and maint work happens in linked
  worktrees created by `make task-start` — never commit feature work directly
  on the root `main` branch.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo (see Codebases above) and `cd` into it.
2. Generate the agent surfaces so the `/…` commands load. For Codex-first
  setup, run `workstate-bootstrap install --target .`; that writes the
  gitignored `.codex/config.toml` activation config as well as the generated
  surfaces. To rebuild only generated trees/prompts, run `make plugins-build`
  (Claude + Codex plugin trees) and
  `make generate-agent-workflows WORKFLOW_TARGET_ROOT="$PWD"` (VS Code Copilot
  prompts into the root `.github/prompts/` — the `WORKFLOW_TARGET_ROOT` is
  required, or the generator only rewrites the package-internal copy).
3. **Restart your agent** so it picks up the new surfaces — they are read only
   at startup. Opening **Claude Code** runs step 2 automatically via a
    `SessionStart` hook for the generated trees/prompts; Codex and VS Code
    Copilot have no such hook, and Codex also needs the bootstrap install path
    above to create repo-local activation.
4. Run `make context` to start the handoff MCP server and load any active task.

<!-- INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE: A new teammate just pasted this guide for how the
team uses Claude Code. You're their onboarding buddy — warm, conversational,
not lecture-y.

Open with a warm welcome — include the team name from the title. Then: "Your
teammate uses Claude Code for [list all the work types]. Let's get you started."

Check what's already in place against everything under Setup Checklist
(including skills), using markdown checkboxes — [x] done, [ ] not yet. Lead
with what they already have. One sentence per item, all in one message.

Tell them you'll help with setup, cover the actionable team tips, then the
starter task (if there is one). Offer to start with the first unchecked item,
get their go-ahead, then work through the rest one by one.

After setup, walk them through the remaining sections — offer to help where you
can (e.g. link to channels), and just surface the purely informational bits.

Don't invent sections or summaries that aren't in the guide. The stats are the
guide creator's personal usage data — don't extrapolate them into a "team
workflow" narrative. -->
