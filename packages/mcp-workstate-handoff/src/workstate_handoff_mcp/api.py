Pass sections='identity' for an identity-only response (active + limits, no data sections). The identity payload also carries the canonical compaction advisory at data.compaction_advisory (with a mirrored data.compaction_recommended boolean flag) per WORKSTATE-REF-1 — callers MUST read advisory state from this surface rather than recomputing token/char totals locally. WORKSTATE-REF-76: data.compaction_advisory.contract_source publishes the resolved contract path and thresholds, the package-reference contract metadata when available, and a drift flag; data.compaction_advisory.recommended_action names the explicit record action (e.g. 'compaction(operation=record)') when recommended=true. Pass detail='summary' to truncate long rationale and verification fields. For exact-read on the decision ledger, sections must include decisions_recent and pass any of decision_fields (allowlist projection), decision_branch, decision_commit_sha, decision_lane_id, or decision_id_prefix (literal-prefix; LIKE wildcards are escaped) to filter decisions_recent without raw SQL. WORKSTATE-REF-71: pass read_profile='identity'|'hot_summary'|'review_packet'|'open_items'|'full_debug' for a named intent shape that expands to the existing sections/detail/top_n_* knobs; explicit lower-level args still override the profile, and the response reports the applied shape under data.read_shape.
