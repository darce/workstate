"""concept_embeddings store: embed-on-write + backfill over handoff concepts.

internal. Canonical storage is a little-endian float32 vector BLOB
keyed by ``(entity_kind, entity_id)``; re-embed is gated on ``(text_hash,
model_id)`` so an unchanged concept embedded by the same model is never
re-embedded. Embedding runs best-effort *after* the concept row's own write has
committed (see :func:`embed_concept_best_effort`) — never inside the write
transaction — so provider absence or inference failure leaves the write path
byte-identical to today, and any gap is reconciled by the resumable backfill.

This module imports numpy and therefore belongs to the optional ``embeddings``
subpackage; the core server's write paths import it lazily and treat an
``ImportError`` (numpy/extra absent) as a no-op.
