"""Write-context cluster for workstate_handoff_mcp.

Extracted from _shared.py (implementation note of WORKSTATE-REF-12-10). Contains:
  - WriteActor TypedDict
  - ResolvedWriteContext dataclass
  - _resolve_core_override()  — shared monkeypatch-fallback helper
  - build_write_actor()
  - _first_non_empty_env()
  - _run_cmd()
  - _detect_git_write_context()
  - _git_is_ancestor()
  - _classify_commit_relation()
  - _workspace_git_context()
  - _resolve_write_actor()

All symbols are re-exported from _shared.py for backward compatibility.

Imports from _shared are done at function level (late imports) to avoid a circular
module dependency: _shared.py re-exports from this module at its end, so module-level
imports in this file would create a deadlock when this module is loaded first.

    — the row has no branch identity yet, so derivation is impossible
    and there is no failure to report. Raises
    :class:`WorktreeNotFoundError` when ``target_branch`` is set but
    ``git worktree list --porcelain`` either fails or produces no
    matching entry; that path is the loud-failure gate the WORKSTATE-REF-52
    plan calls for, so WORKSTATE-REF-44's wrong-cwd attribution invariant
    cannot be re-broken by stale row data silently falling through.

    ``workspace_root`` controls which git context the porcelain query
    runs against. When omitted, falls back to
    ``get_runtime_config().workspace_root`` and finally to cwd, mirroring
    the resolution order used by :func:`_git_repo_root`.

    the worktree from the row's canonical ``target_branch`` would abort the

    clearing it lets actor resolution fall back to caller cwd.

    Clears only when the worktree is genuinely missing: a canonical close
    (worktree intact) is left untouched, so active-path strictness is
    preserved everywhere except the off-canonical recovery. Returns the
