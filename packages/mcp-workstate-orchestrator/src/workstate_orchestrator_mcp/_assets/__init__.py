"""Bundled runtime assets shipped with the orchestrator package.

These resources (lane management scripts, review prompt guides, the
contract-change checklist) used to be looked up at consumer-repo paths
such as ``<orchestrator_root>/scripts/worktree-lane`` or
``<orchestrator_root>/docs/workstate/rules/branch-review-guide.md``.
That coupling forced every consumer repo to vendor the package's own
files, which drifted across consumers and broke installs that did not
ship the orchestrator from a sibling source checkout.

The fix: the orchestrator now owns these files inside its own package
tree and resolves them via ``importlib.resources``. Consumers may still
override the rules directory or the script path explicitly, but the
default lookup never leaves the package.
