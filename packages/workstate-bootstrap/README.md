# workstate-bootstrap

Pip-installable CLI that hoists the shared workstate-system surface
(typed protocol, two MCP servers, hooks, skills, generated agent
workflows) into consumer repositories. Lives inside
[`darce/workstate`](https://github.com/darce/workstate).

Consumers run `workstate-bootstrap install --target <path>` once; it
clones the monorepo, materializes the overlay, and registers both
managed MCP servers (`mcp-workstate-handoff`, `mcp-workstate-orchestrator`)
across `.mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, and `.codex/config.toml`. No
hand-edits required.

## Install

### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
uvx --from workstate-bootstrap workstate-bootstrap install --target /path/to/your/repo
# or, persistent:
uv tool install workstate-bootstrap
```

### From the monorepo source tree (development)

```bash
cd packages/workstate-bootstrap
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Direct from git (private-repo phase, before PyPI release)

One-shot (no install — fetches each invocation):

```bash
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/darce/workstate@workstate-bootstrap-v0.2.1#subdirectory=packages/workstate-bootstrap" \
    workstate-bootstrap install \
    --target /path/to/your/repo
```

Persistent (recommended once you start running `status` / `doctor`
regularly — installs `workstate-bootstrap` onto `$PATH`):

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/darce/workstate@workstate-bootstrap-v0.2.1#subdirectory=packages/workstate-bootstrap"
# then:
workstate-bootstrap status --target /path/to/your/repo
workstate-bootstrap doctor --target /path/to/your/repo
# upgrade later:
uv tool upgrade workstate-bootstrap
```

> **Hardlink warning on first install?** If you see
> `Failed to hardlink files; falling back to full copy`, your `uv`
> cache and tool dir live on different filesystems. The install still
> succeeds; silence the warning with `export UV_LINK_MODE=copy` in
> your shell profile.

## Subcommands

```text
workstate-bootstrap install --target <path> [--remote-ref <tag>] [--mcp-servers <default|path>] [--no-mcp-servers]
workstate-bootstrap update  --target <path> --remote-ref <tag>
workstate-bootstrap status  --target <path>
workstate-bootstrap doctor  --target <path> [--mcp-servers <default|path>]
workstate-bootstrap repair  --target <path> [--force-dirty] [--mcp-servers <default|path>]
workstate-bootstrap adopt-worktree [--target <linked-worktree>] [--primary <root>] [--check] [--json]
```

- `install`: Clone the monorepo, materialize SHARED + GENERATED
  surfaces, write the three MCP-config files, run `init-state` to
  provision `<target>/.task-state/handoff.db` (skipped under
  `--no-mcp-servers`), set `core.hooksPath`, and write the overlay
  manifest.
- `update`: Re-run install at a new `--remote-ref`; refresh GENERATED
  surfaces and, optionally, configs.
- `status`: Print a summary of the installed overlay manifest. When
  the install registered MCP servers, also reports the resolved
  `state_dir` / `db_path` / `exports_dir` / `schema_version` via
  `init-state --check`.
- `doctor`: Detect drift in SHARED, GENERATED, config, and
  initialized-state surfaces. Flags missing `.task-state/handoff.db`
  as `state_drift` only when the manifest recorded `.mcp.json`. Exit
  `1` when drift exists.
- `repair`: Restore drifted surfaces flagged by `doctor`. For an
  unadopted linked worktree this routes to `adopt-worktree` (below).
- `adopt-worktree`: Materialize the overlay into a **linked git
  worktree** by redirecting its surfaces at the primary's
  `.workstate/remote` clone (one hop, relative links). `--target`
  defaults to the current directory; the primary is resolved by the
  `.workstate-bootstrap.json` marker unless `--primary` is given.
  `--check` reports drift without writing and exits `1` when the
  worktree is unadopted. A no-op on the primary worktree.

### Linked worktrees

A linked worktree (`git worktree add`, or an IDE/agent auto-worktree)
shares the primary's `.git` but **not** gitignored files, so the
overlay starts absent — the plugin is enabled (tracked
`.claude/settings.json`) but unresolvable. Self-heal works as follows:

- **`make task-start`** (the supported flow) adopts the overlay into the
  new worktree automatically, so it works out of the box. In source
  checkouts, the lifecycle uses the freshly provisioned worktree `.venv`
  `workstate-bootstrap` command when available, then falls back to `uvx`.
  Set `WORKSTATE_ADOPT_CMD=""` to disable auto-adopt, or set it to a custom
  command to override that default.
- **Post-provision bootstrap** — after adopt, `make task-start` can also run
  a consumer-declared shell command (for example `npm install`) via
  `LIFECYCLE_WORKTREE_BOOTSTRAP` in the root `Makefile`. Best-effort,
  worktree-rooted, `sh -c` semantics; see the development-workflow rule doc.
- **Raw `git worktree add` / auto-worktrees** are healed on demand:

  ```bash
  uvx workstate-bootstrap adopt-worktree --target <worktree>
  # or, as a steady-state guard (exit 1 on drift):
  uvx workstate-bootstrap adopt-worktree --target <worktree> --check
  ```

`.task-state/`, `DASHBOARD.txt`, and `CURRENT_TASK.json` are **never**
adopted — they stay per-worktree (the handoff DB is primary-rooted).

See [`docs/CONSUMER.md`](https://github.com/darce/workstate/blob/main/docs/CONSUMER.md)
for the consumer-facing walkthrough (upgrade, drift handling, skill
overrides, the `current_task_auto_regen` migration note).

## Surfaces written by `install`

The canonical source of truth for bootstrap-managed surfaces is the
installer implementation in
`src/workstate_bootstrap/install.py` (`SHARED_SURFACES` and
`GENERATED_SURFACES`). Keep this table aligned with those constants.

| Surface                              | Source     | Layer       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| `scripts/hooks/`                     | shared     | symlink     |
| `.github/hooks/`                     | shared     | symlink     |
| `docs/workstate/contracts/`            | shared     | symlink     |
| `docs/workstate/rules/`                | shared     | symlink     |
| `Makefile.d/` non-excluded children  | shared     | carved dir  |
| `scripts/workstate/` non-excluded children | shared | carved dir  |
| `.github/prompts/`                   | generated  | real dir    |
| `.workstate/generated/plugins/workstate-system/base/` | generated | real dir |
| `.workstate/generated/plugins/workstate-system/effective/` | generated | real dir |
| `.mcp.json`                          | generated  | real file   |
| `.vscode/mcp.json`                   | generated  | real file   |
| `.codex/config.toml`                 | generated  | real file   |
| `core.hooksPath` git config          | generated  | git config  |
| `.task-state/handoff.db`             | runtime    | sqlite      |
| `.task-state/exports/`               | runtime    | dir         |
| `.workstate/remote/`                   | bootstrap  | git clone   |
| `.workstate-bootstrap.json`              | bootstrap  | manifest    |

`.task-state/` is provisioned by the handoff server's `init-state`
subcommand at install time and is gitignored — each fresh checkout
regenerates it through `workstate-bootstrap install`.

## Defaults

- `--profile` defaults to `all`, which materializes the full surface
  set: generated Copilot prompts, Claude/Codex plugin trees, shared
  overlay surfaces, and the lifecycle hoist
  (`Makefile.d/lifecycle.mk` plus the sentinel-bracketed `-include`
  block in the consumer `Makefile`). Pass `--profile minimal` for a
  clone-only install with no surfaces, or `--profile lifecycle` for
  just the lifecycle runner and Makefile fragment. The active profile
  is recorded in `.workstate-bootstrap.json` under `"profile"`.
- `--remote-url` defaults to `git@github.com:darce/workstate.git`.
- `--remote-ref` defaults to `main` (override with a release tag like `v0.1.0`).
- `--mcp-servers` defaults to the built-in managed map registering
  `mcp-workstate-handoff` and `mcp-workstate-orchestrator` via `uvx` with
  `--workspace-root . serve-stdio`, so Codex, VS Code, and Claude
  clients start real MCP stdio servers from the generated config.
  Pass a JSON file path to override; pass `--no-mcp-servers` to skip
  the three config writers entirely.
- Plugin overrides are auto-discovered at
  `workstate-overrides/workstate-system/` when that root contains an
  `overrides.yaml` manifest. Use `--plugin-overrides <path>` on
  `install`, `update`, `doctor`, or `repair` for a non-default root;
  bootstrap records that path so later update/doctor/repair runs reuse
  it. Override-aware installs generate effective plugin trees under
  `.workstate/generated/plugins/workstate-system/effective/{claude,codex}`
  and point marketplace pins at those generated trees.
- `install` and `update` preserve plugin override files by default.
  `--reset-overrides` is the explicit destructive path; it removes only
  the resolved override root, refuses dirty git worktrees unless
  `--backup` is supplied, and archives backups under
  `.workstate/override-backups/<timestamp>/` before removal.

## Development

Tests live under `tests/`. From the monorepo root:

```bash
cd packages/workstate-bootstrap
PYTHONPATH=.:src:../workstate-protocol/src pytest tests -q
```
