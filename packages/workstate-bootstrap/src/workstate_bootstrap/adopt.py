"""Adopt the bootstrap overlay into a linked git worktree (implementation note, Slice S1).

A linked worktree shares the primary's ``.git`` but not gitignored files, so the
bootstrap overlay is absent until it is adopted. ``adopt_worktree`` re-runs the
*existing* install materialization passes against the worktree, but with
``clone = <primary>/.workstate/remote`` — reusing the battle-tested carve logic,
foreign-file precedence, relative-link computation (links point one hop at the
primary's real clone), and the lifecycle real-file hoist.

Isolation is safe-by-construction rather than via a runtime allow-list (decision
``adopt-drop-runtime-allowlist-for-materializer-scope-invariant``):

* The materializer only ever touches the recorded shared/generated/lifecycle
  surfaces + the clone — the per-worktree mutable set (``.task-state``,
  ``DASHBOARD.txt``, ``CURRENT_TASK.json``, ``state-backups`` …) is never a
  surface, so it is never adopted.
* ``.workstate/`` is kept a real *local* directory; only its ``remote`` and
  ``generated`` children are symlinked to the primary, so sibling per-worktree
  state under ``.workstate/`` stays local.
* ``_run_init_state`` / MCP presync are intentionally NOT run — the worktree uses
  the primary-rooted MCP server; adopt never fabricates a second ``.task-state``.
