"""Installed hook-surface coherence assessment (implementation note implementation note).

Pure/offline module: ``assess_hook_coherence(target)`` inspects an installed
overlay target and returns findings for the four gate families:

- **resolve-every-script** — every ``command`` path named by a rendered hook
  config must stat through the live symlink chain exactly the way the harness
  resolves it. A config naming a deleted/moved guard script is the incident
  class (WS-TERMGUARD-RETIRE-01 fallout: stale clone config invoking the
  payload-deleted ``terminal-guard.py`` fail-closed an entire Copilot
  session). ERROR.
- **same-snapshot provenance** — the config-bearing and script-bearing
  surfaces (and every other ``SHARED_SURFACES`` mount) must resolve to the
  same snapshot. Mixed mounts (one surface → stale ``.workstate/remote``
  clone, another → live payload) are how the incident substrate formed.
  ERROR for the two hook surfaces, WARN for non-hook shared surfaces (they
  degrade behavior — e.g. a stale ``Makefile.d`` recipe — but cannot
  fail-close a harness).
- **stale-clone** — a surface symlinks into ``.workstate/remote`` whose HEAD
  no longer matches the receipt ``remote_sha``. WARN (offline-only by
  design: a long-lagging clone whose configs still resolve only warns).
- **orphan / hybrid-receipt** — an on-disk hook config absent from BOTH the
  receipt (``surfaces[]``/``configs[]``) and the renderer's expected-output
  map is unmanaged: update()/doctor will never refresh or flag it (the
  consumer committed-``.codex/hooks.json`` class). WARN. A
  ``source_kind=package`` receipt whose surfaces nevertheless symlink into a
  ``.workstate/remote`` clone is the hybrid incident substrate. WARN.

No network access anywhere; every probe is local stat/readlink/git-plumbing.
