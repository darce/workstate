"""Minimal install flow for the workstate-bootstrap CLI.

This slice implements four responsibilities:

1. Clone (or fast-forward) ``<remote_url>`` at ``<remote_ref>`` into
   ``<target>/.workstate/remote/``.
2. Symlink the six known shared overlay surfaces from the clone into the
   consumer repo, preserving any pre-existing real local directory at the
   same path (overlay precedence: local wins per surface).
3. When ``mcp_servers`` is provided, configure the three consumer-tool
   surfaces — ``.mcp.json`` (Claude Code), ``.vscode/mcp.json`` (VS Code),
   and ``.codex/config.toml`` (Codex CLI) — by deep-merging or
   tomlkit-replacing only the managed entries while preserving everything
   else the user had configured.
4. When ``<target>`` is a git repo, point ``core.hooksPath`` at the
   materialized ``scripts/hooks/git`` directory so git resolves shared
   hooks by name (``post-checkout``, ``pre-commit``, ``pre-push`` …).
   The parent ``scripts/hooks/`` symlink ships Python helpers and other
   non-git-hook files; setting ``core.hooksPath`` there makes git
    silently resolve nothing; the bootstrap-managed git hook directory is the
    only valid hooksPath target.
5. Write ``<target>/.workstate-bootstrap.json`` describing the resolved remote,
   the materialized surfaces, and the configs that were touched. Older
   installs wrote ``.workstate-overlay.json``; the legacy file is migrated
   in-place on first run when present.

The ``doctor`` / ``repair`` / ``update`` / ``status`` subcommands are
implemented in adjacent modules and are deliberately out of scope here.

        enforce_required_surfaces: When True, refuse the install if any
            surface declared as required by the manifest fails to
            materialize. Defaults to False (warn-only).
