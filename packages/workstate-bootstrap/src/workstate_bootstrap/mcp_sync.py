"""Config-only MCP-server reconciliation for ``workstate-bootstrap``.

Public entry point ``sync_mcp_configs(target, mcp_servers, *, surfaces,
check_only)`` rewrites (or, in check mode, only inspects) the three
client config surfaces and the bootstrap ledger's ``mcp_servers``
provenance block — without fetching the remote, regenerating skill
surfaces, or running ``init-state``. ``install`` and ``mcp-sync`` share
the same render seam in ``install.py`` so byte output is identical.

This module is parameter-only by design (no implicit file discovery
past what is passed in) so non-CLI callers — Make targets, the
``bootstrap doctor`` drift check, future release helpers — drive the
same code path as the CLI subcommand. implementation note covers the basic check
+ apply paths plus the surfaces filter; ``--prune-removed-managed``
lands in a follow-up slice.
