"""Pure linked-worktree / overlay-root detection helpers (implementation note, Slice S0).

A linked git worktree (``git worktree add``, Claude Code's
``.claude/worktrees/<name>/``) shares the primary's ``.git`` but not gitignored
files, so the bootstrap overlay (``.workstate/``, ``.workstate-bootstrap.json``,
the materialized shared surfaces) is absent until it is adopted. The adopt path
needs three pure questions answered before it mutates anything:

* Is this path a *linked* worktree (vs the primary, a bare repo, or a plain
  directory)? — :func:`is_linked_worktree`.
* Where is the *primary* overlay root, identified by its authoritative marker
  ``.workstate-bootstrap.json`` rather than by assuming the git root? —
  :func:`primary_overlay_root`.
* Is a given root actually materialized (marker + clone present)? —
  :func:`overlay_is_materialized`.

These helpers shell out to ``git`` read-only and never write. The marker name
and clone subdirectory are imported from :mod:`workstate_bootstrap.install` so
there is a single source of truth.

    Starts at ``parent(--git-common-dir)`` (the primary git root — for a linked
    worktree this is the *primary*, not the worktree) and walks toward the
    filesystem root looking for the first directory that contains
    ``.workstate-bootstrap.json``. The marker is authoritative: the overlay is
    NOT assumed to sit at the git root, because nested-source layouts place the
    git repo inside the overlay directory.

    The walk prefers a **materialized** overlay (marker + ``.workstate/remote``
    clone): an *unmaterialized* stray marker — a leftover marker file in an
    ancestor (a developer home dir, a sibling repo's overlay one level up) with
    no clone — is skipped so a real materialized overlay higher up wins, instead
    of silently mis-resolving the primary to the stray. If a marker exists but
    *no* overlay at/above the start is materialized, the nearest marker is
    returned so the caller surfaces the specific "not materialized" error rather
    than a misleading "no marker found".

    Trade-off (intended): preferring a materialized ancestor is what makes the
    nested-source layout (git repo *inside* the overlay) resolvable at all, since
    the primary git root legitimately carries no marker there. The cost is that a
    not-yet-installed project that ships a tracked marker but sits *under* a
    separately-materialized ancestor overlay resolves to that ancestor (adopt
    proceeds against it) instead of failing loudly. This is an accepted,
    recoverable best-effort outcome (re-install in the project to fix it), not a
    silent data hazard; the supported ``make task-start`` flow (sibling worktrees
    of a normally-bootstrapped primary) never hits it.

    Raises :class:`OverlayMarkerNotFoundError` when no marker is found at all
    (the primary is un-adopted / not bootstrapped), and
    :class:`NotAGitRepositoryError` when ``path`` is not in a git repo.
