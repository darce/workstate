"""Handoff state schemas (Schema #1 from founding implementation note).

These are the cross-repo contract types for handoff state. They model
the wire shape that ``mcp-workstate-handoff`` exposes to MCP clients and
that ``mcp-workstate-orchestrator`` consumes — not the on-disk SQLite row
shape, which is an implementation detail.

Compatibility note: ``ActiveTask`` is permissive on extra keys
(``extra='allow'``) because the underlying handoff DB row carries
columns that this schema does not yet model (revision metadata, lane
metadata, etc.). As subsequent schema slices land, those fields
graduate from passthrough to typed.
