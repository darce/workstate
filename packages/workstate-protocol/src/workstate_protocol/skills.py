"""Skill manifest schema (Schema #4 from founding implementation note).

Structured contract for the canonical neutral skill layout
``skills/<slug>/skill.yaml`` (implementation note step 1). The pre-Plan-0002
``.claude/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`` frontmatter is now a *generated*
artifact in target repos and is no longer a source-of-truth surface.
Enforces the Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 portability boundary by
requiring an explicit ``scope`` declaration on every skill —
preventing project-specific skills from being accidentally hoisted
into the harness overlay.

``extra='allow'`` so existing harness fields (``mode``, ``context_budget``,
``mcp_tools``, ``tdd_gate``, ``makefile_target``, etc.) round-trip
unchanged. The schema only enforces the cross-repo portability
contract; consumer-specific validators continue to enforce their own
fields locally.
