# Makefile.d/plans.mk — plan-targets surface (implementation note implementation note stub).
#
# This file is hoisted into consumer repos by workstate-bootstrap and
# included by their root Makefile (`include Makefile.d/*.mk`).
#
# In implementation note only the launcher contract is locked in; the recipe bodies
# are stubs that exit non-zero with a "implemented in Slice N" message.
# Slices 2-4 replace the stub bodies with real recipes; consumers
# update by re-running `workstate-bootstrap update --remote-ref <pin>`.
#
# The launcher token reuses the same distribution and isolated
# environment that bootstrap pins for the MCP server
# (`uvx mcp-workstate-handoff serve-stdio` in .mcp.json), so a freshly
# bootstrapped consumer can run the plan targets without any
# `pip install mcp-workstate-handoff` step. Override
# `WORKSTATE_HANDOFF_PLAN_CLI` to a bare `python -m ...` invocation if the
# consumer manages its own venv.
#
# Every recipe forwards `--workspace-root $(CURDIR)`
# so a coordinator on `main` does not need to preflight
# `WORKSTATE_HANDOFF_WORKSPACE_ROOT=$PWD` in their shell. `plan-show` also
# forwards `PLAN_MODE=baseline|working-copy|auto` and raw
# `PLAN_ARGS='--working-copy'` so operators can choose which snapshot
# (main baseline vs feature-branch working copy) the resolver returns,
# without needing to drop down to `plan_cli` directly. PLAN_MODE maps
# to the matching CLI flag (`--<mode>`); when both PLAN_MODE and
# PLAN_ARGS are set, PLAN_MODE wins on conflict simply because it is
# emitted first on the argv.
