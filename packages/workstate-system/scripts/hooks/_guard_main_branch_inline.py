"""Inline Python implementation for scripts/hooks/guard-main-branch.sh.

Promoted from a `python -c '...'` heredoc inside guard-main-branch.sh
to a standalone module so bash quoting cannot break the script. This is
the same bug class eradication as WORKSTATE-REF-20 (_task_start_inline.py).

Reads two positional arguments set by guard-main-branch.sh:
    sys.argv[1]  REPO_ROOT  — absolute path to the repository root
    sys.argv[2]  BRANCH     — current git branch name

Reads JSON tool-invocation payload on stdin (Claude Code hook protocol).

Exit codes:
    0 — allow (optionally prints a BLOCKED reason to stdout for the
        bash wrapper to relay to stderr)
    2 — hard block (contract missing or unrecoverable error)
