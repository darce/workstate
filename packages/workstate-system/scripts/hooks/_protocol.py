"""Shared helper for validating hook payloads against workstate-protocol.

Hook entrypoints call ``validate_event(payload, expected="PreToolUse")``
on the dict they read from ``json.load(sys.stdin)``. The helper:

- Returns the validated Pydantic model when ``workstate-protocol`` is
  installed and the payload validates.
- Returns ``None`` when ``workstate-protocol`` is not installed (partial
  rollouts) so hooks can fall back to local parsing.
- Logs a single-line warning to stderr when the payload doesn't match
  the expected event type, instead of swallowing the failure silently.

Hooks that need strict behavior can import the model directly and
raise on failure; the helper is the lenient default.

The optional ``log_warning`` flag lets callers route the warning
elsewhere (e.g. a file, syslog) without rewriting the helper.

            given, mismatch is reported. When ``None``, the helper

    of returning ``None``. This lets CI/strict developer setups treat
    payload drift as a hard failure without each hook re-implementing
    the gate. The protocol-package-missing case never escalates — a
    hook running without the contract package installed is a build
    issue, not a payload issue.
