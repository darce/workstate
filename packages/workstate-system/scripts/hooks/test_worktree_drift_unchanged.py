"""WORKSTATE-REF-03 implementation note: pin that ``_worktree_drift.py`` remains the
hard contract for PreToolUse file-mutation edits to protected paths
from the wrong worktree.

The parent scope explicitly requires this: ``branch-lifecycle/body.md``
documents ``_worktree_drift.py`` as the Cold-Start runbook's
file-mutation hard contract. WORKSTATE-REF-03 relaxes the post-merge
``check-main-clean`` surface (implementation note) but **must not** relax the
file-mutation surface — that would be a silent regression of the
runbook.

These tests use ``evaluate_payload`` directly so the assertions cover
the policy core, not just the subprocess shim. The hook script itself
remains untouched in WORKSTATE-REF-03 implementation note; this module exists to fail loudly
if a future refactor reroutes the file-mutation contract.
