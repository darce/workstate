# git-plan-cat.sh — `git plan-cat [task-ref]` shell wrapper.
#
# Hoisted into consumer repos by workstate-bootstrap. Backs the optional
# `[alias] plan-cat = !git-plan-cat.sh` entry described in
# docs/CONSUMER.md; users opt in by adding the alias to their
# `.gitconfig`. The Make targets remain the canonical entrypoint, so
# this wrapper exists purely as a `git`-native convenience that resolves
# through the same `workstate_handoff_mcp.plan_cli show` path the Makefile
# drives — guaranteeing byte-for-byte parity with `make plan-show`.
#
# Override `WORKSTATE_HANDOFF_PLAN_CLI` to bypass the default `uvx` launcher
# (e.g. when the consumer manages its own venv). Any
# extra positional arg is forwarded as the task ref; with zero args the
# resolver falls back to the active task, matching `make plan-show`.
