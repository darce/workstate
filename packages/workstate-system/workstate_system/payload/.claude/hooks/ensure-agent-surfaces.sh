# SessionStart hook — ensure this clone's GENERATED agent surfaces exist.
#
# Three agent surfaces are generated into GITIGNORED paths, so a fresh clone
# carries the pins/sources but not the generated output — and the surfaces
# silently fail to load until they are built:
#   - Claude plugin tree  .workstate/generated/plugins/workstate-system/base/claude  (make plugins-build)
#   - Codex  plugin tree  .workstate/generated/plugins/workstate-system/base/codex   (make plugins-build)
#   - VS Code Copilot      .github/prompts/                                       (make generate-agent-workflows)
#
# This hook regenerates all of them when missing. It can only run on CLAUDE CODE
# session start — Codex and VS Code Copilot have no equivalent trigger (see the
# README "Developing in this repo" section) — but because `plugins-build` emits
# BOTH plugin trees and `generate-agent-workflows` emits the Copilot prompts,
# opening Claude once bootstraps every surface. Plugins load only at session
# start, so a one-time restart is needed after the first build. The hook is a
# no-op (fast, silent) once the surfaces exist and never blocks session start.
