"""Shared hook helper: resolve / re-exec under a deps-bearing interpreter.

Harness-agnostic. Every harness (Claude Code, VS Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok)
launches these hooks via a bare ``python3`` command -- see the per-harness
``*_command`` fields rendered from ``harness-protocol.yaml``. The hook
*scripts* are the single shared artifact all of those commands invoke, so the
interpreter hardening lives here (one place -> every harness) rather than in
the ~60 per-harness command strings.

A system Python upgrade can leave the launch ``python3`` without the workstate
runtime deps (``pydantic`` and friends), which silently turns stack-importing
hooks into no-ops. These helpers route hook work to the project ``.venv``
python, which the bootstrap install keeps synced. Repo root is resolved via
``git`` -- no vendor-specific env var.

Two entry points by hook shape:

- ``ensure_deps_interpreter()`` re-execs the *current* process under the venv.
  Use it for hooks that import the stack in-process (compaction, reinjection);
  they fire infrequently (Stop / SessionStart) so the re-exec cost is fine.
- ``resolve_deps_python()`` returns a deps-bearing interpreter path *without*
  re-execing. Use it for hooks that run the stack in a subprocess and fire on
  every event (e.g. record-file-touch on PostToolUse), where re-execing the
  whole hook per event would add latency.
