"""Mutating ``task-finish`` subcommand.

Wraps the canonical end-of-task close sequence documented at
``packages/workstate-system/skills/branch-lifecycle/body.md`` step 9 in a
single Make-callable target so the order is mechanical and a stalled
operator never leaves an inconsistent dashboard / unarchived task row /
orphaned linked worktree behind.

The sequence:

1. ``mcp-workstate-handoff set --task-ref <ref> --status done --status-only``
   — flip the live row to ``done`` so the row is archive-eligible.
2. (Best-effort) record any open worktree lanes for the task. Lane
   close itself has no direct CLI surface in
   ``mcp-workstate-orchestrator``; if open lanes are detected the receipt
   surfaces a ``lane_close_skipped`` warning so the operator knows to
   close them via MCP before re-running. Absent a state DB or
   orchestrator install we proceed silently.
3. ``sync-task-plan-checklist --quiet`` — final full-plan sweep, VERIFY-ONLY
   (dry-run, no ``--apply``) while the active row's ``task_plan_path`` and
   decision/test evidence are still readable. task-finish runs POST-merge in
   a worktree it is about to delete, and plan docs reach the integration
   branch ONLY via the feature-branch merge — so writing ticks here would
   silently discard them. A non-zero dry-run ``ticked`` therefore means the
   merged plan is missing evidence-backed boxes (the operator skipped the
   pre-merge ``finalize-plan``); it is surfaced as a ``plan_checklist_drift``
   warning rather than written. The persisting sweep lives in the
   ``finalize-plan`` subcommand, run on the feature branch BEFORE merge.
   Failure-as-warning: a malformed plan never blocks the close sequence; the
   slim sync receipt is merged under the ``checklist_sync`` key.
4. ``mcp-workstate-handoff archive --operation archive --task-ref <ref> --apply``
   — move the row into ``task_archives`` and snapshot status.
5. ``mcp-workstate-handoff render-handoff --kind dashboard`` — regenerate
   ``DASHBOARD.txt`` from the updated state.
6. ``git worktree remove`` for the row's ``target_worktree_path`` when
   it points at a real linked worktree distinct from the primary
   repo — the linked worktree is no longer needed once the task is
   archived. The close sequence itself dirties the worktree (step 3's
   ``sync-task-plan-checklist --apply`` ticks a plan box — an uncommitted
   tracked edit) and ``make task-start`` provisions a ``.venv``, so the
   *safe* ``git worktree remove`` fails on essentially every finished
   task. ``--force`` is therefore applied automatically, but ONLY when
   ``target_branch`` is fully merged into the primary HEAD: then every
   committed change is already preserved on the integration branch and the
   only working-tree content discarded is the close sequence's own
   regenerable side-effects. An unmerged/unknown branch never auto-forces
   (its worktree may hold the only copy of unmerged work). Failure is
   reported but does not flip ``ok`` to false: the canonical state already
   reflects the close, and the operator can finish teardown manually.
7. ``git branch -d`` for the row's ``target_branch`` when it exists
   locally, is fully merged into the current HEAD, is not the branch
   currently checked out, and is not checked out in another linked
   worktree. ``-d`` is the safe variant — git itself refuses unmerged
   branches — so the worst case is a ``skipped_unmerged`` receipt
   field, never a destructive surprise.

Step ordering is load-bearing: archive MUST run before the worktree
remove so the write-side guard still sees a live worktree at the time
the archive write lands. The branch delete MUST run after the worktree
remove because git refuses to delete a branch that is checked out in a
worktree — including the linked worktree we just tore down. Inverting
the archive/worktree order is the failure mode the
``mcp-workstate-handoff`` write-side-guard scope captures (see
``docs/scopes/handoff-write-side-guard-archive-no-worktree-scope.md``).

Folding the branch delete into this target removes the previous
``manual git branch -d`` step from the branch-lifecycle skill and
eliminates the post-merge contingency where the row's ``target_branch``
no longer mapped to a live worktree at the time the close ran (the row
is set/archive-written *before* the branch is deleted here). It also
keeps the cleanup inside an authorized make target, so the auto-mode
classifier never sees a standalone ``git branch -d`` invocation.
