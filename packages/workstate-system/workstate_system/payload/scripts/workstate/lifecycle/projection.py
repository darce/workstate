"""Projection adapter wrapper (implementation note implementation note).

Mirrors a lifecycle-runner decision into the handoff DB via
``mcp-workstate-handoff event record``. When the adapter is unavailable
the call must spool the payload to
``.task-state/pending-workflow-events.jsonl`` so a later
``make project-events-replay`` can retry it. Adapter failure never
blocks the primary git operation.

Status mapping:

* ``synced`` — the underlying CLI exited 0 *and* did not return a loud
  ``ok:false`` envelope. (The handoff CLI prints its JSON envelope and
  always exits 0, so a zero-exit ``ok:false`` is treated as a rejection,
  not a sync — see :func:`_rejection_data`.) The returned id is the one
  parsed out of the CLI's JSON response when present, otherwise the
  supplied ``decision_id`` (caller-id fallback matches the
  skill-broadcast wrapper).
* ``spooled`` — the CLI ran and rejected the payload (any non-zero
  returncode that is *not* a CLI-unreachable signal). The payload is
  appended to the pending-events spool so a later replay can retry,
  and the receipt surfaces the loud failure to the operator.
* ``pending`` — the CLI could not be invoked at all (missing binary
  or timeout). The payload is still spooled, but the receipt routes
  the case as a transient unreachability rather than a contract
  rejection.
* ``error`` — the caller passed a malformed payload (e.g. empty
  ``decision_id``); short-circuits before the adapter is touched.
