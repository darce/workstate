"""Guard that managed MCP-server ``uvx`` pins do not silently drift.

The two Workstate MCP servers ship their consumer launch specs as
hand-maintained ``<distribution>@<version>`` pins in **two intentionally
separate** sites (different consumers — live developer config vs. emitted
plugin manifests — that may diverge later; see the header comment in
``mcp_servers.yaml``). Neither site is touched by
``scripts/release_prepare.py``'s dependency-floor rewriter, so bumping a
server package does not move its pins.

That gap shipped a real bug in the ``v0.1.22`` release: ``mcp-workstate-orchestrator``
was bumped ``0.5.0 -> 0.5.1`` but both pin sites kept saying ``@0.5.0``, so
package-source / default-server installs launched the superseded ``0.5.0``
wheel. A follow-up ``v0.1.23`` release was needed to correct the pins.

This module makes that drift impossible to ship silently. It verifies that
for any *managed* server (one that is pinned in a primary pin site) every
surface agrees with the expected version:

Primary pin sites (authoritative):
  1. ``packages/workstate-bootstrap/src/workstate_bootstrap/install.py``
     — ``DEFAULT_MCP_SERVERS[...]["args"][0] == "<distribution>@<version>"``
  2. ``packages/workstate-system/workstate_system/payload/config/agent-workflows/mcp_servers.yaml``
     — ``mcp_servers[].args[0] == "<distribution>@<version>"``

Coupled surface (also verified so a stale doc cannot ship):
  3. ``packages/workstate-system/docs/plugin-distribution.md``
     — the operator-copyable ``<distribution>@<version>`` JSON snippets.

Two entry points:

* ``check_release_bump(repo_root, package_name, new_version)`` — used by
  ``scripts/release_prepare.py`` to FAIL a managed-server bump when the new
  version does not already match every pin surface.
* ``main()`` / ``make check-mcp-pins`` — standalone steady-state check
  (usable in CI / preflight). With no ``--package`` it checks every managed
  server against its own published (``pyproject.toml``) version.

A mismatch is **reported, never auto-rewritten**: updating a pin is coupled
to updating its drift-guard tests and ``docs/plugin-distribution.md``, and a
blind rewrite would leave those out of sync. The operator changes all of
them deliberately.

Detection is **deliberately conservative**: each surface is scanned for *every*
``<distribution>@<version>`` occurrence (not just the load-bearing
``args[0]``), and a surface is OK only when every occurrence agrees with the
expected version. So a stale version mentioned anywhere in a primary site —
even in a comment or an unrelated snippet — is treated as drift. This is
fail-closed by design: for a release guard, loudly flagging a stray version
reference (the operator removes or updates it) is safer than parsing only one
position and missing a real second pin.
