"""Guard that a publishable package's shipped payload cannot change without a version bump.

implementation note S1. The 0.1.x release shipped two whole feature arcs (implementation note +
0019) of ``workstate-bootstrap`` / ``workstate-system`` changes with **no
version bump** — their PyPI versions silently fell behind ``HEAD`` because the
shipped payload lives in dirs (``scripts/``, ``Makefile.d/``, ``.github/``,
``skills/``, ``docs/``) that do not *look* like package source, and the missing
tags hid it. This gate makes that impossible to ship silently.

For each publishable package (``config/release/packages.json`` ``publish:true``),
it finds the commit that *set* the current ``pyproject`` version and fails if
any file under the package's **shipped payload** changed *after* that commit. A
clean bump (no payload change since the version was set) passes.

The version-set commit is found by parsing each ``pyproject.toml`` revision with
``tomllib`` (NOT a brittle source-text pickaxe), so any valid TOML spelling of
the version is handled. If the current version cannot be located in git history
at all (e.g. an uncommitted bump), that is a *hard failure*, not a silent skip.

"Shipped payload" is the UNION of every surface the wheel ships, derived from
the build config:
  * ``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`` source keys (the overlay
    surfaces ``workstate-system`` ships), AND
  * ``only-include`` / ``packages`` roots (the importable namespace), AND
  * a fallback of ``<pkg>/src`` for an ordinary src-layout package, AND
  * the ``[project]`` table itself (minus ``version``) — wheel METADATA such as
    dependency pins is shipped payload, the whole payload for a meta-package
    like ``workstate-stack``.

Run standalone (`make check-release-version-drift`), via ``release.sh``
preflight / the single-package path, or the CI publish-plan step.
