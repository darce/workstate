"""Orchestrate the public Workstate release flow (dry-run by default).

This is the single release-owned command that composes the existing release
tooling into one repeatable public-release path:

  1. preflight  — verify every publishable package has a matching PyPI Trusted
                  Publisher binding for ``darce/workstate`` /
                  ``release-publish.yml`` / ``pypi`` (reported in dry-run, the
                  live PyPI probe is gated behind ``--execute``),
  2. export     — build the public tree via ``scripts/export_public.py``,
  3. push       — push the exported tree to ``git@github.com:darce/workstate.git``
                  (``--execute`` only),
  4. tag-sync   — create the per-package tag family plus the consumer-facing
                  ``vX.Y.Z`` monorepo tag on the public commit (``--execute`` only),
  5. status     — a unified report distinguishing the five release states.

Dry-run is the default. Network-mutating steps (git push, tag push) run ONLY
under ``--execute`` *and* an interactive operator confirmation *and* a passing
publisher preflight. Every mutating step is idempotent (re-running converges:
the export rewrites history and tags are force-synced to the new commit). PyPI
upload is intentionally out of scope — it is a separate, explicit step: after
this command syncs sources + tags to darce/workstate, the operator dispatches
``gh workflow run release-publish.yml`` (Trusted Publishing, the primary path).
Local ``twine`` upload remains only the documented fallback.

    Three idempotent steps, each shelled out so the orchestration is
    hermetically testable (stub ``git`` on PATH + the ``RELEASE_PUBLIC_*`` env
    seams):

      1. export    — build the fresh-history public tree (single scrubbed
                     commit) via ``scripts/export_public.py --out <tmp> --force``.
      2. push      — force-push that commit to the public ``main``. The export
                     rewrites history every run, so a force replacement is the
                     intended, convergent behavior.
      3. tag-sync  — create the per-package tag family (``<pkg>-vX.Y.Z``) plus
                     the consumer-facing ``vX.Y.Z`` monorepo tag on the exported
                     commit and force-push them.

    PyPI upload is intentionally out of scope: it is a separate, explicit step.
    After this command syncs sources + tags to darce/workstate, dispatch
    ``gh workflow run release-publish.yml`` per pending package (Trusted
    Publishing, the primary path; see docs/RELEASING.md). Local ``twine`` is
